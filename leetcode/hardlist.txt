124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
101. Symmetric Tree
Max XOR(set)
wiggle sort 2( O(n), nth_element A(i) nums[(1+2*i)%(n|1)])
327. Count of Range Sum 想不出来，用multiset 先insert 0 ？
343. Integer Break why factors are 3(prefered) and 2
If an optimal product contains a factor f >= 4, then you can replace it
with factors 2 and f-2 without losing optimality, as 2*(f-2) = 2f-4 >= f.
So you never need a factor greater than or equal to 4, meaning you only
need factors 1, 2 and 3 (and 1 is of course wasteful and you'd only use it for n=2 and n=3, where it's needed).
For the rest I agree, 3*3 is simply better than 2*2*2, so you'd never use 2 more than twice.

311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication
存的是非0项的坐标。。。。。。


301. Remove Invalid Parentheses
不用for 循环。。。。直接用idx迭代，(((去掉哪个 情况都是一样的。。。。
